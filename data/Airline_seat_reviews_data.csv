0,Economy Class,Boeing 737-8AS,3x3,April 2023,Solo Leisure,5,1,3,5,4.0,yes,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 12F. This was a great seat for the price paid for my ticket (£24). I chose random allocation so I didn't pay for the seat. I was given 12E (the middle seat - a classic Ryanair punishment for not paying for a seat, but the 12F passenger didn't show up so I moved. I had a small under seat bag, and still had plenty of legroom. "
1,Economy Class,Boeing 737-8AS,3x3,May 2023,Solo Leisure,5,1,4,5,5.0,yes,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 26A. This was a randomly allocated seat, and in terms of the view, behind the wing on the port side (left) of the plane. Good view and good legroom for the price paid."
2,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3,February 2023,Couple Leisure,1,1,1,1,1.0,no,,,"Not Verified |  Booked extra legroom seats for me and my partner, especially since usual seat layout is well too cramped for a 6'2"" man. Was allocated 1B and 1C which was fine. Except priority boarding which came with the allocation was nonsensical since everyone and his dog has to file past us to reach their seats. Plus the cabin crew seats are directly opposite and they're not comfortable either so my leg room got totally compromised during take off and landing, and by their backwards and forwards servicing all the other passengers during the entire flight. The two seats need to be positioned closer to the aircraft side to provide non-contact by the food, beverages, and duty free trollies - or else what's the point of paying for extra leg room? The crew were very polite but that didn't make up for a very uncomfortable flight when comfort was the very thing we paid extra money for. Budget should never mean discomfort."
3,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3,November 2021,Family Leisure,4,1,4,3,2.0,yes,,,"Not Verified |  The seat was unusually thin, the coating of it felt like fabricated plastic. The seat did not recline nor did it have a moveable head rest. Fortunately, the leg room was pretty decent. There was enough room to put my backpack under the seat. The seat is comfortable for the first 2 or 3 hours of the flight, however after that it becomes very uncomfortable. Good enough for a budget airline though!"
4,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3,March 2022,Couple Leisure,1,1,1,1,1.0,no,1.0,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified |  The seat is bolt upright, with no adjustment or storage. While a seat like this might be suitable for ultra short haul it is not suitable for a flight of four hours. Very uncomfortable seat, it must be the worst in class. It deserves a zero rating."
5,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3,August 2021,Family Leisure,3,5,3,5,4.0,yes,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Small legroom like most European airlines, but not that bad for tall people, this is because although the legroom is small, the seats don't recline, and for tall people, at least for me is a big plus, because once the seats in front of you recline, the legroom is completely gone. With Ryanair you are guaranteed that the person in front if you will not recline the seat, and since Ryanair trips are not long haul, I'd say its a good compromise for tall people."
6,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3,November 2019,Solo Leisure,3,1,2,2,1.0,yes,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  
Review of the older Ryanair seat: No seatback pocket, no adjustable headrest, and no recline. The seat cushion also lacks support, causing numbness after sitting there for 2 hours. Cabin hygiene was more or less passable, but those seats do make storage a little awkward due to the lack of an intermediate storage space when you begin to put things away. That being said, it does give you a little extra leg room, which would matter for taller people. The seats are obviously quite narrow, and legroom is more cramped, but being 5’8, I had more than enough leg room."
7,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3,November 2019,Business,1,1,1,1,1.0,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Seats are very uncomfortable, had neck pain pain for 2 days after the trip. They assigned me a random seat obviously the worst I can get just because I didn't pay extras."
8,Economy Class,Boeing 737,3x3,October 2019,Couple Leisure,2,1,1,3,1.0,no,,,Not Verified |  Ryanair is renowned for cheap flights and if booked well in advance my return from Manchester to Gran Canaria was £42. I bought 2 tickets and paid extra for the front row of seats having loads of leg room and priority boarding etc. The bill went from £84 to £269 for the 2 of us. On boarding at Manchester the cabin crew had sat somebody in our seats and made us sit us regular seats. I explained I had paid a lot of money for those seats to refused to sit there. I contacted Ryanair to have their T and C quoted to me that they can move people if for safety and security and would not get a refund. In all it’s a waste of money and customers service is outweighed by greed. I agree you get what you pay for but I paid and didn’t get anything of the sort.
9,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3,May 2019,Solo Leisure,4,2,3,5,2.0,yes,,,✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 17D in the emergency exit row. Lots of legroom and priority boarding. Seats in the emergency exit row on this aircraft are narrower than other seats because the tray table stows in the armrest. It's still worth paying for this seat to get the extra legroom if you're tall. I think the seats may be made of vinyl and the back support is not that great but it's okay for short flights.
10,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3,May 2019,Solo Leisure,1,1,1,1,1.0,no,,,✅ Trip Verified |  This airline is a no no for people over 1.85 meters in Height. I am something taller than that and I had trouble fitting my knees straight. They do inform you with seat space but it is a marketing trick that they don't say you can't fit if you are above a certain height. 3/10 just cause it's super cheap
11,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3,April 2019,Solo Leisure,1,1,1,1,1.0,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Seats too small, tidy, almost no leg space. No screen, No flight tracking, No free entertainment, No free water, No free food, No free snacks. Very small space for your baggage in the cabin. "
12,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3,June 2018,Solo Leisure,3,1,3,4,1.0,no,,,"Not Verified |  This was my first flight with Ryanair from Düsseldorf-Weeze to Pisa. Since I am not a really tall person and normally thin, the seat width and legroom was okay for me. I've expected worse. But the recline of the seat was very uncomfortable. It's not enjoyable sitting in there for two hours. The aisle space was nothing special and acceptable. TV-Screens, seat pockets and seat power supply are non-existent. In the end I wouldn't recommend this airline. You get what you pay for but I'd rather pay a bit more for a healthy back."
13,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3,December 2017,Couple Leisure,3,1,1,1,1.0,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Ryanair's randomly allocated seating policy is such a mess. Any other airline allows you to sit with your family if there is room. Ryanair forces you to sit separately unless you pay an additional 10-18 euro per person per direction. All this does is creates chaos when everyone tries to swap their seats around during boarding. I sat in row 33 while my husband sat in row 9. Upon disembarking most families, ourselves included couldn't easily find each other and this in turn caused more confusion in the passport line. The seats themselves are typical of a low budget airline, thin and uncomfortable with no recline."
14,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3,October 2017,Couple Leisure,2,1,2,2,1.0,no,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I’ve just checked in with Ryanair for the two of us and have selected their “Free” random seating, I have been given a seat in row 10 and my partner a seat in row 22! When I then try to go and change the seats the seats either side of us on each row are free and we can sit next to each other for a fee. Why could the random seating not seat us together when there are all these two seats together which are free? Oh, it’s because Ryanair want to con you out of more money to sit together! Not even your your children are safe from this con as you have to pay to sit next to them. No other airline has stooped as low as Ryanair! Also if you decide to sit next to a loved one the cost of the seat is considerably higher than if you sit say 2-3 rows behind, so they even increase the seat fee to sit right next to them, Ryanair you have no morels! I would suggest that you definitely do not pay the fee con and instead on boarding the aircraft during boarding stand in the aisles and ask other passengers with the same problem as there are many to try and swap with you, as there will be lots of you doing this it will slow down the boarding and cause issues for Ryanair but why should you care? It is Ryanair that has changed their seating process and caused you more stress so this is how we now have to sort it out!"
15,Economy Class,Boeing 737,3x3,November 2017,Couple Leisure,1,1,1,2,1.0,no,,,✅ Verified Review |  We flew from Leeds to Alicante. I checked in on line 3 minutes after it opened. I did not wish to pre purchase seats as we had just paid £69.99 for each seat.They allocated 15E for me & 28E for my wife. When I was seated there was the window seat next to me & the window seat on the opposite row both vacant. I have emailed Ryan air 3 times now suggesting that their policy has changed & they purposely allocate seats apart so you will pay the extra money. They have replied but not answered the seat allocation problem. We fly to the Uk about every 6 weeks but no more with this airline.
16,Economy Class,Boeing 737,3x3,August 2017,Family Leisure,1,1,1,2,1.0,no,,,"✅ Verified Review |  Absolutely terrible. I'm 6'4"" and even on an aisle seat, I couldn't fit my knees behind the seat in front. The seats don't recline at all either, the cushions are rock hard and the upholstery is so slippery that you slip down all the time. By far in a way the most uncomfortable flying experience I've ever had. Will never use them again."
17,Economy Class,Boeing 737,3x3,July 2017,Couple Leisure,1,1,1,1,1.0,no,,,"❎ Unverified |  The worst airline I have ever flown with. What kind of customer service is it when you are deliberately separated from the person you are travelling with. My partner and I recently travelled from Manchester to Krakow and desite checking in at the earliest possible time on the outbound flight I was right at the back sandwiched between two random people and my partner was right at the front. On our return flight despite an empty seat next to me I was at the front and my partner at the back. This is supposed to be random there is nothing random about it, this is deliberate. I am only 5 foot 2 inches in height and as you can imagine trying to get my luggage into the hold is difficult for me I rely on my partner to help me. Of course no cabin staff was available to ask and had to embarrassingly ask another passenger for assistance. Apart from that no other complaints but why cant Ryanair just be nice to their customers not only that by splitting people up causes disruption boarding and unboarding the plane and as a result on our outward flight we missed our flight slot for take off due to passengers taking longer to board."
18,Economy Class,Boeing 737,3x3,April 2017,Couple Leisure,1,1,1,4,1.0,no,,,"❎ Unverified |  I hadn't flown Ryanair for a good number of years and had forgotten how dire the experience was. The seats are so squashed and uncomfortable you can barely move and because you can't recline the seat or have any leg room to stretch out you can't even look out of the windows in a window seat! I got back ache on holiday because of the uncomfortable flight. Then there's that horrible yellow interior, just dreadful.  I'm in my 40s now and realise that a bit of comfort when travelling is worth paying for."
19,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3,December 2015,Couple Leisure,1,1,2,1,1.0,no,,,"I took two flights with Ryanair in a week, first from Warsaw to Tenerife and then from Tenerife to Linz, and I was assigned to the seat 33A on both flights. The seat is the very last one in the corner. The legroom does not differ significantly from the others on any Ryanair aircraft. Nor do any seats recline at all. The main problem, I suppose, is that there are no luggage space over this row (33) on their aircraft. Besides, it sometimes happens that the smell from the toilets come to the cabin. For example, it did happen on the second flight to Linz."
20,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800 ,3x3,November 2015,Couple Leisure,4,1,3,4,1.0,yes,,,"Have no real problems with Ryanair leg room or seat width (unless someone large is sitting beside me) as both my wife and myself are under 5ft 8ins. Also am glad that the seats do not recline as I have travelled on charter flights in the past almost pinned in my seat by the reclined seat in front. However, neither my wife and I are keen on Ryanair's so-called leather seats, as we find that after a couple of hours we start to stick to them and they become increasingly uncomfortable. The absence of a seat pocket is a mixed blessing: while there is nowhere to store the things one wants to be at hand on the flight, at least you don't get banged in the back by the person behind fumbling in his / her seat pocket."
21,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3,October 2015,Couple Leisure,4,5,2,3,5.0,yes,,,Not the comfiest of seats. However I like the fact that there is no reclining option for the passenger in front to make your trip more uncomfortable. Good option
22,Economy Class,Boeing 737,3x3,October 2015,Solo Leisure,1,5,2,2,2.0,no,,,"Adjustable airline seats cause too many problems with a thoughtless passenger reclining his/her seat so much that they are almost lying on the person behind them. However the Ryanair legroom is far too small. I am a small person (5'3"") but my knees are up to the seat in front. On my last flight I had a guy of about 6'1"" behind me and his knees were constantly jammed into my back. He could not help it. There should be a seat 'area' that all planes and all airlines have to use."
23,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3,September 2015,Solo Leisure,1,1,1,1,1.0,no,,,"Seats are too close and uncomfortable, you cannot move them front or back, you must seat like a soldier standing still. Even in sort flights you feel very uncomfortable on those seats."
24,Economy Class,Boeing 737,3x3,August 2015,Solo Leisure,2,1,3,3,2.0,yes,,,"Average seats with no recline mechanism, not enough legroom and width for a tall or wider person."
25,Economy Class,Boeing 737,3x3,July 2015,Solo Leisure,1,1,1,1,1.0,no,,,"The seats are hard and uncomfortable, at 6ft 3"" I struggled to fit in, and I had an aisle seat. Not much else to say, other than the colour scheme inside the planes is nauseating. That bright yellow needs to be got rid of! Priority boarding is a must."
26,Economy Class,Boeing 737,3x3,June 2015,Solo Leisure,5,1,4,5,5.0,yes,,,Prebook a priority seat and ask for Row 16 which is the exit row. If no one else pays for and reserves an exit row seat you may be th eonly person sitting in the exit row even if the rest of the aircraft is packed. Exit row seats are not assigned to regular passengers. The leg room is great which compensates from the fact that none of the seats on Ryanair recline which is a good thing in that you never have the seat in front of you pressed against your face or run the risk of a passenger in front pushing back their seat while you are eating a meal or when you have a drink on the drop-down tray and it ends up on your lap. The thing you need to do with Ryanair is to know and follow the rules. 
27,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3,July 2015,Family Leisure,4,1,3,5,3.0,yes,,,Seats were comfy and clean. I'm 5'9 and my son is 6'1 and we had enough room. Seatback in front is recessed where your legs go so it provides more legroom. These seats do not recline.
28,Economy Class,BOEING 737,3x3,,,5,1,5,1,,no,1.0,,Ryanair seats are poor in that they do not touch or support your back from your shoulders downwards. they are fixed ie they do not recline which is a good thing so that the person in front does not end up in your lap. Pay the extra and get the emergency aisle rows it is well worth it.
29,Economy Class,BOEING 737,3x3,,,3,1,2,2,,no,0.0,,Seats are not adjustable apart from one arm the inside one raising up. which means you have to squeeze past the initial arm when sitting down No pocket on the back of the seat in front to store or keep things while visiting the toilet. Advertising in every available place. No sick bag provision. Very little room to move when tray folded down.
